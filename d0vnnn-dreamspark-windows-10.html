Today it seems to have de-activated itself and is asking for a Windows 10 product key. I contacted Microsoft and was informed that as I used a Windows 8 Dreamspark key, they don't support upgrading it to 10.

Greetings everyone, I bought a new PC and on the old one I have windows installed from dreamspark since I was a student (I don't have access to dreamspark anymore). The specific version name is "Windows 10 Multiple Editions 32/64 bit (English) - DreamSpark". Since I have the product key saved I was wondering if I could use it for my new PC. I would deactivate the key from my old pc since I don't need it anymore, but I can't find the answer if this kind of licence is transferable and with which. As some of you may already know, IST currently indicates that their Dreamspark subscription has expired (https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/software-students/other-available-software-students), which means that currently students are unable to get activation keys for Windows 10.

Allegedly, I can get a free copy of Windows 10 through my college via Dreamspark, but I'm curious as to how it works. I downloaded the media creation tool from MS's website, so When I redeem my copy through dreamspark, am I just given a key that I put in after I install it via USB?

Windows 10 Education is still usable and for the most part fine. However, it does have an annoying watermark in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and it would.  Building a new computer this summer and wondering if the Windows 10 Pro available on Dreamspark can be installed by a USB boot. Reading the description it's saying its an update I just had to pay to keep using Windows 10 because my windows 7 key was "free" through my college using dreamspark (MSDNAA). Apparently that key is considered an Enterprise key and when I tried to call and reactivate Windows 10 they refused to do it telling me it isn't a home version of the product. I had no clue dreamspark keys aren't able to be upgraded as I was able to do so without issue. I graduated a while ago and no longer have access to my college's dreamspark. Just be careful. 
I'm a dreamspark member, and I'm using Windows 8.1 Industry Pro. Will DreamSpark users able to upgrade to Windows 10? If so, I really want to know the approximate release. Hi all! I tried to search for the answer but couldn't really find the answer that I wanted or an answer that could help me. So fortunately my school has a dreamspark program, and I unfortunately and stupidly happened to use a Windows 10 key on my laptop, even though I had a free upgrade to Windows 10 back in the summer, which I think effectively wasted the upgrade because the key has now been attached to that computer (I wanted the Pro version instead of Home for Remote Desktop Connection. So my college activated DreamSpark Premium licence and i'm thinking of taking windows 10, but i have few questions. On official page it says that it can be used for "the purpose of learning, teaching and research" so my pc where i both learn and game is forbid from using it? Does that means i can lose licence for windows 10 and possible be sued? Thanks. </p>
