                            <p>Hi guys, as title says, when in the BIOS I can use my PS2 KB and USB mouse but on the desktop only my PS 2 kB works. I checked my device manager and I have several devices listed as "Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller" or "Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller". What gives? I have a feeling it has to do with my windows drivers but I tried updating those through the device manager and it said they were fully updated. I'm highly considering doing a clean wipe if it will solve the proble. When I plug in something via USB (flash drive, external drive, smartphone), it acts as it should. File transfer is as fast as it should be. They are NOT 3.0 ports, but there are some of those in the back that I could never get working. After a random amount of time between five seconds and five minutes, the device disappears from Windows, only to reappear two seconds later as if it had been unplugged and plugged back in. However, the file transfer speed is much lower. It will not repeat 
Hey reddit, I just built my first gaming PC so I installed steam once I had it built. I tried to download TF2 It finished and started working but when I got into a game it was so choppy I couldn't play it. at the spawn area in Dustbowl I had around 8 FPS. I was confident that my PC would be able to run TF2 and much more without any trouble. I installed Counter Strike Source and it was better but still sort of choppy. I checked and I was getting around 25-45 FPS depending on what was going I am looking to maybe changing my AMD and Motherboard but anything else I should change?

Well, my family is usually doing some pretty hard gaming, and when I try to play certain games, (specifically TF2) if I max out the settings, (even setting it to DX10) will, instead of lagging, begin to flicker the screen with black and grey lines, and if it cools down quickly, leaves the mouse as a glitched mess, and then crash. and auto-reboots. I would like to figure out how to set a limit for how much my PC can do, to say, underclock it? PC SPECS: MOBO: Manufacturer Product SerialNumber. I am new to Reddit i just came to ask this question what should i buy to make my computer run faster idk legit anything i bought a premade computer a while ago and i kinda want it to run faster.

Hello i recently upgraded my graphics card in my computer and have had some issues with games. Some of my most played games are more or less unplayable now. For example Dota 2 crashes to desktop in the middle of matches without an error message and sometimes it causes my entire computer to lock up and i'm forced to restart the computer manually. Many other steam games also crash much more frequently. Some games are even unplayable F.E.A.R 3 causes my computer to restart without any error messag. I've disconnected all USB devices as well as USB expansion card. System is constantly connecting and disconnecting a USB "Device" at location Port_#0006.Hub_#0001.

Hi guys, I'm having trouble understanding what the difference between a "Standard openHCD USB host controller" and a "Standard Enhanced PCI to USB host controller" is. I'm trying to connect a 3D scanner for my father's company to a new computer that I built this weekend. The 3D scanner is kinda old and not compatible with a USB 3.0 port. But even when I connect the scanner to USB 2.0 ports, it's still not being recognized. To figure out what the problem I downloaded usbview. The computer. It seems to only happen whenever I'm gaming, and its happened 4 times so far. I don't remember all the games, but it happened during CS:GO twice each time about 30 minutes into the game. (To be clear, I've left the computer on for hours without this happening, and it doesn't happen during simple games like Hotline Miami or Rogue Legacy.) Everything immediately goes black, even faster than if I were to just cut the power. When I turn it back on it doesn't give me the black screen that says "Wind. I'm currently buying a laptop locally using a similar site to craigslist. He has offered 0 for it and I'm wondering if this is worth the price and will it be able to play most video games.

So I recently had my computer stolen. Thankfully, I recovered it. However, when I recovered it my original two user accounts were gone and replaced with a new one. All programs I previously had exist, although some are broken. When I got it back there was a program running called Recuva. I let it continue, and it seemed to find my old files, although it could not restore them to their original locations. Additionally my computer has now been running MUCH more slowly. I'm wondering if there's. Before the wipe I had a dual screen set up which worked wonderfully. Now however my computer will display on both screens but only shows that one is plugged in. I tried searching the internet last night and the best I got is the driver for one of my monitors, though it hasn't helped any. The computer reads the monitor(s) as being connected through a hdmi via vga adaptor and will not allow me to set either to the proper resolution(1600x900). And finally(though probably connected the display. Hello, for the past few weeks my desktop has been having issues with freezing and occasional blue screens of death. I use my set-up mostly for gaming and work (consists mostly of statistics using excel and preparing presentations/documents). Freezing seems to occur in various different instances and is inconsistent, meaning doing something that caused the PC to freeze earlier might not cause it to freeze a second time. Generally, it seems to freeze a lot when I'm playing certain games Greetings. Recently i've been having an issue with my computer because it would seem to do a windows update and then my graphics card would crash, seemingly because of a bad driver. I would have to do a system restore every time because new drivers just would not install. So, I stalled and hardly restarted my computer, but the power went out recently and of course it happened again. But this time it would not revert back, even with a system restore. It would just show green/pink lines Hey all! So I have done tons of research trying to get this to work correctly, and nothing has helped me at all. Just know that before I start =P I started playing maybe a week ago, and it has been frustrating as all hell. I can get maybe 5-10 minutes of gameplay in MAX before my screen turns black (whole screen, not just the PokeMMO window), comes back with the PokeMMO window being fully white (sound still playing), and it unresponsive. If I click the window again I get a pop-up 
Build Help Hi, I recently bought a MSI CR61 3M-025BE as a gift for an old man. Since he is 84y/o and his win XP desktop gave out i thought i'd help him out. MSI CR61 3M-025BE comes standard with windows 8. This OS is to difficult for him so I decided to put on it a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium, and so I did. I managed to get the W7 64x up and running but I'm having trouble finding some correct drivers for it. + no internet on that laptop because the lack of drivers, so no auto-update. what the heck is happening?? Help! so I have had this system for a while, 6 Core AMD Windows, I run PT 8 LE, and never had an issue ever. I changed nothing. It's on a workstation that isn't on the internet. I have PLENTY of RAM and Hard Drive space (1 TB+ left) I started getting errors that said " Access Violation occurred, unable to read location 0x00000004 at address 0x62235AD0 in module DAE.dll " when I was recording </p>
